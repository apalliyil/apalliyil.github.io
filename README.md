## Deployment Instructions

1. To update the site with the latest changes, run ```mpm run build``` to run the build command to prepare the project for deployment by creating a build directory. 
2. Then, run ```npm run deploy``` to push the contents of the build directory the ```gh-pages``` branch and update the contents of the Github Pages site. 

  *Note: the changes might take a few minutes to propagate on the site*
